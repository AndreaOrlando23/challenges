# The Queue Data Structure with Elixir

### Queue data structure explanation

Queue is a FIFO data structure. It is possible to image it as a line of people (items) waiting for their turn. The queue front is the end with the item that has waited the longest. The queue rear is the end an item enters when it starts to wait. The front is called head and the rear is called tail.
