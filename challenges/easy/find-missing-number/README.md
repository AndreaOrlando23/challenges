# Find the missing number

You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number.

**Bonus point**: What are the time and space complexities of your solution?

## Example

```js
const list = [1,3,2,10,5,8,6,7,9];
const missingNumber = findMissingNumber(list);

console.log(missingNumber); // => 4
```
