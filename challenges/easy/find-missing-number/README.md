# Find the missing number

You are given an unsorted array containing all the integers from 0 to 100 inclusively. However, one number is missing. Write a function to find and return this number.

**Bonus point**: What are the time and space complexities of your solution?

## Example

```js
const list = [230, 222, 220, 224, 229, 221, 225, 223, 228, 226];
const missingNumber = findMissingNumber(list);

console.log(missingNumber); // => 227
```
