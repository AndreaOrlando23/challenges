# Queue or Stack ?
### When it is better to use one or the other?

###STACK
The data structure is LIFO: last in, first out.

A metaphor to understand. <br/>
We can imagine it as CD holder: you insert the CDs on top of each other, so that if you want to reach the first you insert, you need to remove all the others.

Application.<br/>
We can use this type of data structure to develop a tool that need to go back in the history of actions to undo a certain action.


###QUEUE
The data structure is FIFO: first in, first out.

A metaphor to understand. <br/>
The word is quite self-explanatory: imagine a queue at the supermarket: the first person who go in the checkout line will be the first to pay and go out of the supermarket.

Application.<br/>
We can use this type of data structure to develop a tool that need to keep a specific order, for example the software that manage a printer.
