# Contributing

Here are the contribution guidelines for the **TomorrowDevs** challenges.

## Creating new challenges
New challenges must observe the following rules:

1. **They must be language-agnostic**. Problems can be solved in any programming language.
2. **Different difficulty levels**. Each problem must have at least two difficulties level (easy, hard).
3. The user should be able to solve the problem using pseudo-code if their code doesn't compile or throw an error.
4. Every problem must have a README.md file explaining:
5. The problem itself
6. At least two different difficulty levels
7. A reference for the student to some documentation that could help them solve the problem
8. Every problem must have one category.
9. Every problem README.md file must implement the (template file)[README_TEMPLATE.md].

## Solving a problem
1. Solutions must be submitted by opening a pull request. The pull request must observe the following rules:
2. The branch name should be formatted as `solution/<problem-name>` for example: `solution/binary-search`
3. The solution must be placed inside of a folder using your name or username. Example: `micheleriva/solution.js` or `mitch/solution.js`
4. The solution file must be placed inside the "challenges" folder in the problem subdirectory. For example: `/challenges/binary-search/solutions/micheleriva/solution.js`
5. Every commit must adopt the conventional commits rules. Learn more (here)[https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/]
